// call play on a song 
// the play event from the song
// bubbles up through library (the collection that the song is in)
// to the app (an AppModel instance) which changes the currentSong to the song that sent the play trigger 
// app view is listening for any change in currentSong. app view calls playerView's set song, which
// changes player view's model to the new song and re-renders



// call ended on a song 
// the ended event from the song
// bubbles up to SongQueue (a collection that the song is in)
// which removes the ended song from the queue and uses PlayFirst to play the next song
// which then does everything specified above, incl. updating and re-rendering PlayerView
